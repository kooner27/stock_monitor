# Stock Monitor ðŸ“ˆ

A Rust-based command-line application to fetch and visualize stock market data, including candlestick charts with highlighted volatile days. The app uses the Yahoo Finance API to retrieve stock quotes and Plotly for interactive chart generation.
---

## Features

- Fetches historical stock data for the last 6 months.
- Generates an interactive candlestick chart in HTML format.
- Highlights volatile trading days (days where the high-low spread is greater than 2% of the close price).

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rust**: Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kooner27/stock-monitor.git
   cd stock-monitor
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   cargo run -- --ticker AAPL
   ```

   Or, if you don't provide a `--ticker`, the program will prompt you to input one interactively.

## Example Output

Plotly will generate an interactive html file.
Open it with a browser or your favourite html viewer.
Below is a snapshot for **AAPL** stock (last 6 months):

## Usage

### Command-line Arguments
